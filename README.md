1. Have clone of master.

2. In directory type 
  `git checkout -b "'YourInitials''specific-name'"`

  `git commit -m"Descriptive Message"`  
  `git push origin 'Branch Name'`

5. Navigate to github.com

6. Go to repo and click on the pull request at top.

7. In there add users to the request @'Username', and click send pull request.

  `git checkout master`  
  `git pull`  
  `git branch -d 'Branch Name'`
