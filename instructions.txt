Directory for everything: /Users/appleseed/Documents/school/cs660/compiler ~ The terminal will already be in this directory. 

Our demos are in the Demos folder. They are also here in this sublime window. [bubblesort.c,iterfact.c,matrix_multiplacation.c]

To run our stuff:
python driver.py demo/[source file]

Add a -c for source code output in the three address code generated.

The tac file by default goes to the log folder and is named 3AC.tac.
It will already be open in this sublime.

To change that name simply use a -i [filename].

For help messages command line params use -h.

More detailed instructions on the website or ask Vinh or Chase.
